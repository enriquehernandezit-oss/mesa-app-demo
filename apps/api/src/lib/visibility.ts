// one drifting copy is how a visibility rule (a security control) silently goes
// wrong. Defined once here, they compose straight into inArray/notInArray with
// no extra round trip. Each returns a fresh builder, so a statement can use
// more than one without alias collisions.
//
// notInArray against these is safe when empty: it becomes `NOT IN (SELECT …)`,
// which excludes nothing — unlike an empty JS array, which Drizzle would refuse.
